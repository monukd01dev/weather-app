# Weather App

## Overview
The **Weather App** is a fully responsive web application that allows users to get real-time weather data for any location. The app utilizes the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch current weather details. This project demonstrates my ability to work with APIs using JavaScript's `fetch()`, `async/await`, promises, and DOM manipulation. Additionally, I have implemented a **Dark Mode** and **Light Mode** toggle for a better user experience.

The live version of the app is available [here](https://weather-app-mkd.netlify.app/), and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/monukd01dev/weather-app).

## Features
- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Get weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for any city.
- **Dark & Light Mode**: Toggle between dark and light themes for personalized user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive for all devices, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **API Integration**: Fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface with minimal design.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure and layout of the web page.
- **CSS3**: Styling the application, including dark and light mode switch.
- **JavaScript**: Handles API integration, async/await for API requests, promises, and DOM manipulation.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Provides real-time weather data.
- **Netlify**: Used for deploying the app.

    cd weather-app
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser to view the app:
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

4. **Optional**: If you want to add your own API key, replace the existing OpenWeatherMap API key in the `script.js` file with your own:
    ```javascript
    const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
    ```

## Project Features
- **Asynchronous JavaScript (async/await)**: Demonstrates use of asynchronous functions to handle API requests.
- **Promises**: Used for handling API responses and errors.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Updates the UI dynamically based on user input and API responses.
- **Responsive UI**: App works seamlessly on all screen sizes.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark modes for enhanced user experience.
